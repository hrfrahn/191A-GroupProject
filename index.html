            <b>How Did The Pandemic Affect Student Income at UCLA?</b>

            In spring quarter 2021, USAC held an election which included a referendum known as the Bruin Emergency Relief Fund. 
            BERF aimed to “increase undergraduate student fees by $2 per quarter to create an emergency fund for natural disasters, 
            medical costs, legal costs, housing and food insecurity.” This referendum failed to pass. While many factors may have 
            contributed to this result, we wonder if a lack of awareness of their peers and other fellow bruins financial situation 
            was one. Students are left to suffer the burdens of financial insecurity alone with little to no support from their peers 
            and the institution. Feeling left out or being excluded solely because of one's financial situation should not be an 
            additional barrier students face at an institution like UCLA. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened issues for many students, 
            especially financial issues. Remote learning requires access to resources the university had available on campus, but 
            were now unavailable due to relocation.
