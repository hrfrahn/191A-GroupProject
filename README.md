Clicking on the "Student Resources" modal shows you a few resources we have found that could be useful to those who visit the site to share their experience and may be in need. Good Clothes, Good People is a non-profit on campus organization at UCLA that helps provide students with basic necessities. The UCLA Economic Response Team was put together by the institution to provide students with emergency aid or assistance.

The "Click To See Student Responses" section has all the responses submitted by location. By clicking on any location, for instance Pasadena, CA, the map responds by zooming in to that area. The marker then shows some of the responses to certain questions submitted by that individual. On the far right of the mapplication under "Student Open Responses," you can see their response to the open-ended questions listed.
