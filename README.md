  Clicking on the "Student Resources" modal shows you a few resources we have found that could be useful to those who visit the site to share their experience and may be in need. Good Clothes, Good People is a non-profit on campus organization at UCLA that helps provide students with basic necessities. The UCLA Economic Response Team was put together by the institution to provide students with emergency aid or assistance.
